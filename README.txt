With improving my HTML and CSS skills it was now time to focus on JavaScript.

After some time I have found fantastic book helping me with this next step.

The book is called "JavaScript: Programátorské techniky a webové technologie" by author Ondřej Žára. This book helped me understand JavaScript a lot more and gave me a lot of experience, I learned new techniques, new methods of development and ended up with this interesting product - game Atoms.
